# [NOMADS COLLIDE](https://nomads-collide-16050dd2f50c.herokuapp.com)
 
## Who are we?
> Welcome to Nomads Collide, a genuine travel diary that invites you to hop into the passenger seat of my journey through life on the road. This isn't just a project—it's a heartfelt invitation to join me on the winding paths and open road of my adventures, exploring the world one converted Mercedes Vario campervan at a time.
Nomads Collide is the story of how I've turned my campervan into a rolling home for exploring. For me, it's more than just traveling; it's about embracing the nomadic lifestyle, cherishing the freedom of the open road, and discovering the beauty of our planet in its raw and authentic form. I've found that converting a campervan isn't just about creating a vehicle; it's about crafting a home on wheels, a space that allows me to follow my curiosity and live life off the beaten path.
As I share my experiences on Nomads Collide, it's not just about the destinations but the journey itself—the people met, the unexpected detours taken, and the personal growth that unfolds with every mile traveled. Nomadic living in my campervan has become a transformative way to learn about different cultures, connect with nature, and truly understand the beauty of simplicity.
One unique aspect that sets Nomads Collide apart is the inclusion of my furry companions. Converting a campervan enabled me to bring all of my pets along for the adventure. Traveling with them adds an extra layer of joy and companionship to the journey, turning every pit stop into a shared moment of exploration.
Nomads Collide is for those who find solace in the hum of the road, those who believe that travel is not just a destination but a way of life. Whether you're a fellow van lifer, a curious soul contemplating the nomadic lifestyle, or someone seeking inspiration for your own journey, this blog is a window into the beauty of traveling at your own pace.
So, buckle up and join us on unexpected detours, and the meaningful connections that happen when we let the journey guide us. Together, let's explore, learn, and grow—one campervan adventure at a time. Welcome aboard!

## UX
 
### My Design Process
> Putting together my travel blog was a careful process where I considered how it looks and feels for you. The colors, like the soft ones such as #d8a996, #cb9884, and #f1e6e6, were picked to make you feel comfy and give the blog a calm vibe.
I also chose fonts that match the blog's personality. The fancy one for headings, Cormorant Garamond, adds a classic touch, while the clean one for paragraphs, Montserrat, keeps things modern and easy to read.
> Making sure the blog looks good on any device was a big deal. Whether you're using a computer, tablet, or phone, the blog adjusts so you can enjoy it without any hassle.
Getting around the blog had to be easy too. I set it up so you can find what you're looking for without any trouble. Simple and clear navigation helps you explore travel stories, photos, and tips effortlessly.
> And the fact that I travel in a converted campervan with my pets is a big part of the blog's vibe. It's a bit unique, and I wanted that to shine through in both the words and the pictures.
In a nutshell, the blog's design is all about making your visit comfy, enjoyable, and maybe even a little inspiring.

This color is often associated with femininity, tenderness, and a sense of calm. It can be used to create gentle and soothing color palettes in various design contexts, including fashion, interior design, and graphic design. The neutral undertones make it versatile and well-suited for creating elegant and understated color schemes.

## Database Design
> When I was putting together my blog website, sketching out an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) turned out to be helpful in establishing my models. It was like creating a roadmap for the database – making it clear where everything connects. With a tight one-week deadline to get the MVP out, that ERD was my guiding light. It helped me narrow down my focus to the absolute must-haves: user registration and blog post creation.

![erd](https://github.com/StaceyRb89/Nomads_collide/assets/144110082/7844b3d2-7d51-4fc5-99e4-068ae1d1e7a4)

> Deciding to hold off on the comments section was a tough call, but the ERD showed me how complex it could get. So, I deferred it to make sure the MVP hit the ground running. ERDs aren't just diagrams; they're practical tools for smart planning, letting me roll out features one step at a time.

## Agile Development Process
### GitHub Projects
> Github Projects became my go-to hub, helping me juggle the different roles I had to play. With the clock ticking for the one-week MVP, that board kept me sane. It became a visual roadmap, letting me break down tasks into bite-sized chunks. Whether I was coding, designing, or playing the editor, that project board made sure nothing fell through the cracks. Wearing many hats is no joke, but having a structured plan in GitHub made it a whole lot smoother.

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/StaceyRb89/Nomads_collide/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
  
## Projects Board
 
### GitHub Issues
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/StaceyRb89/Nomads_collide/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
> Considering users, administrators, and the marking criteria while writing issues is a strategic approach that helps prioritize and focus on the most crucial features for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). By understanding the needs and expectations of different stakeholders, you can ensure that the initial version of the project meets essential requirements and provides a functional foundation. This iterative and user-centric approach allows for a quicker development cycle, enabling you to deliver a viable product within a short timeframe.
Your emphasis on addressing the most important issues for the MVP demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of project priorities and a commitment to delivering value efficiently. This approach aligns with agile development principles, allowing for rapid iterations and improvements based on user feedback and evolving project requirements. It also sets a solid foundation for future enhancements and feature additions as the project progresses.

## Deployment
 
The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://nomads-collide-16050dd2f50c.herokuapp.com).
 
### ElephantSQL Database
 
This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

![admin database](https://github.com/StaceyRb89/Nomads_collide/assets/144110082/458b70bb-3d06-4369-a173-3ffafff8f18e)

## Local VS Deployment

> Local Development Version:
When working on the local version, I've configured the system to run with debugging enabled. This means that if any errors occur during development, the system provides detailed error messages that I can read and analyze promptly. This debugging capability is immensely beneficial during the development phase, as it allows for quick identification and resolution of issues.

> Live Deployment on Heroku:
Contrastingly, on the live deployment site hosted on Heroku, the debugging mode is set to false. This is a security measure and best practice for production environments. While it enhances the security of the application by not exposing detailed error messages to potential attackers, it does mean that when errors occur, the end-users are presented with a more user-friendly, generic error page.
