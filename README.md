# [NOMADS COLLIDE](https://nomads-collide-16050dd2f50c.herokuapp.com)
 
### Who are we?
Welcome to Nomads Collide, a genuine travel diary that invites you to hop into the passenger seat of my journey through life on the road. This isn't just a project—it's a heartfelt invitation to join me on the winding paths and open road of my adventures, exploring the world one converted Mercedes Vario campervan at a time.
Nomads Collide is the story of how I've turned my campervan into a rolling home for exploring. For me, it's more than just traveling; it's about embracing the nomadic lifestyle, cherishing the freedom of the open road, and discovering the beauty of our planet in its raw and authentic form. I've found that converting a campervan isn't just about creating a vehicle; it's about crafting a home on wheels, a space that allows me to follow my curiosity and live life off the beaten path.
As I share my experiences on Nomads Collide, it's not just about the destinations but the journey itself—the people met, the unexpected detours taken, and the personal growth that unfolds with every mile traveled. Nomadic living in my campervan has become a transformative way to learn about different cultures, connect with nature, and truly understand the beauty of simplicity.
One unique aspect that sets Nomads Collide apart is the inclusion of my furry companions. Converting a campervan enabled me to bring all of my pets along for the adventure. Traveling with them adds an extra layer of joy and companionship to the journey, turning every pit stop into a shared moment of exploration.
Nomads Collide is for those who find solace in the hum of the road, those who believe that travel is not just a destination but a way of life. Whether you're a fellow van lifer, a curious soul contemplating the nomadic lifestyle, or someone seeking inspiration for your own journey, this blog is a window into the beauty of traveling at your own pace.
So, buckle up and join us on unexpected detours, and the meaningful connections that happen when we let the journey guide us. Together, let's explore, learn, and grow—one campervan adventure at a time. Welcome aboard!
 
Consider adding a mockup image using the "Am I Responsive" website.
Here's your deployed site as an example:
https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://nomads-collide-16050dd2f50c.herokuapp.com
 
Screenshots for the README and testing should not be inside of `assets/` or `static/` image folders.
(reminder: `assets/` and `static/` are for files used on the live site, not documentation)
Consider adding a new folder called `documentation`, and add the amiresponsive screenshot inside of that folder.
To add the image into your README, use this format:

## UX
 
🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑
 ### My Design Process
Putting together my travel blog was a careful process where I considered how it looks and feels for you. The colors, like the soft ones such as #d8a996, #cb9884, and #f1e6e6, were picked to make you feel comfy and give the blog a calm vibe.
I also chose fonts that match the blog's personality. The fancy one for headings, Cormorant Garamond, adds a classic touch, while the clean one for paragraphs, Montserrat, keeps things modern and easy to read.
Making sure the blog looks good on any device was a big deal. Whether you're using a computer, tablet, or phone, the blog adjusts so you can enjoy it without any hassle.
Getting around the blog had to be easy too. I set it up so you can find what you're looking for without any trouble. Simple and clear navigation helps you explore travel stories, photos, and tips effortlessly.
And the fact that I travel in a converted campervan with my pets is a big part of the blog's vibe. It's a bit unique, and I wanted that to shine through in both the words and the pictures.
In a nutshell, the blog's design is all about making your visit comfy, enjoyable, and maybe even a little inspiring.
 
### Colour Scheme

It's a versatile and timeless color that can be both soothing and visually appealing.
 
> The background colour - #f1e6e6 is a light and subtle shade of pale pink or blush. It has a delicate and soft appearance, leaning towards a neutral pastel tone. This color is often associated with femininity, tenderness, and a sense of calm. It can be used to create gentle and soothing color palettes in various design contexts, including fashion, interior design, and graphic design. The neutral undertones make it versatile and well-suited for creating elegant and understated color schemes.
 
> The background colour for my posts page - #d3c8c4 is a muted and subdued shade of grayish taupe or light brown. It has a neutral and earthy tone with hints of gray, making it versatile for various design applications. This color is often associated with understated elegance and can be used to create sophisticated and timeless color schemes.

## Database Design
## Agile Development Process
### GitHub Projects
[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/StaceyRb89/Nomads_collide/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.
  
## Projects Board
 
### GitHub Issues
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/StaceyRb89/Nomads_collide/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
Considering users, administrators, and the marking criteria while writing issues is a strategic approach that helps prioritize and focus on the most crucial features for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). By understanding the needs and expectations of different stakeholders, you can ensure that the initial version of the project meets essential requirements and provides a functional foundation. This iterative and user-centric approach allows for a quicker development cycle, enabling you to deliver a viable product within a short timeframe.
Your emphasis on addressing the most important issues for the MVP demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of project priorities and a commitment to delivering value efficiently. This approach aligns with agile development principles, allowing for rapid iterations and improvements based on user feedback and evolving project requirements. It also sets a solid foundation for future enhancements and feature additions as the project progresses.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://nomads-collide-16050dd2f50c.herokuapp.com).
 
### ElephantSQL Database
 
This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.
 
To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
 
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: Nomads_collide).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.

- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.
  
### Heroku Deployment

### Local Deployment
 
This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.
 
For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
 
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
 
You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.
 
Sample `env.py` file:
 
```python
import os
 
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
 
# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```
 
Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
 
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`
